\section{Main theorem and applications}

Construct a functorial $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra structure on the cobar construction of the normalized chains on a simplicial set. This $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra on the cobar construction satisfies the following Hopf condition: it has an underlying dg associative/coassociative Hopf algebra structure. 

Applications: if the natural chain map between the normalized chains on a cubical set and its triangulation preserves the $U(M)$-coalgebra structure (check?) we may deduce that our model is equivalent as a $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra to the normalized chains on the classical Kan loop group functor (this would use recent work of Rivera, Zeinalian, and Minichello).
