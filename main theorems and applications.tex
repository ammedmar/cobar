\section{Main theorem and applications}

Construct a functorial $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra structure on the cobar construction of the normalized chains on a simplicial set. This $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra on the cobar construction satisfies the following Hopf condition: it has an underlying dg associative/coassociative Hopf algebra structure. 

Applications: if the natural chain map between the normalized chains on a cubical set and its triangulation preserves the $U(M)$-coalgebra structure (check?) we may deduce that our model is equivalent as a $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra to the normalized chains on the classical Kan loop group functor (this would use recent work of Rivera, Zeinalian, and Minichello).


Baues lift the cobar algebra over $\Ch$ to one over the category of $P$-coalgebras where $P$ is the Stasheff operad $\mathsf P$. The result is a A-infty coalgebras that happens to be coassociative. Then we came along and lift that algebra over Ch to one over E-infty coalgebras that happens to be coassociative.


\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Mon_{\cSet} \arrow[r, "\chains"] & \Alg_{\coAlg} \\
\sSet^0 \arrow[r, "\chains"] \arrow[u, "\gcobar"] & \coAlg \arrow[u, "\cobar"]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}

we extend this construction to

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Mon_{\cSet} \arrow[r, "\chains"] & \Alg_{\coAlg_{U(\M)}} \\
\sSet^0 \arrow[r, "\chains"] \arrow[u, "\gcobar"] & \coAlg_{U(\M)} \arrow[u, "\cobar"]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
