Let $R$ be a fix commutative ring which we omit from the notation.
We work over the symmetric monoidal category $(\Ch, \otimes, R)$ of chain complexes of $R$-modules.
As usual, we regard the set of $R$-linear maps $\Hom(C, C^\prime)$ between chain complexes as a chain complex.
The $i\th$ suspension functor $s^i \colon \Ch \to \Ch$ is defined on objects by $(s^{i}M)_n= M_{n-i}$.

A \textit{coassociative counital coalgebras} is ... satisfying ... 

We remark that this notion is equivalent to that of a comonoid in the $(\Ch, \otimes, R)$.
We denote the subcategory category of $\Ch$ with these objects and structure preserving morphisms by $\coAlg$.
We notice that $(\coAlg, \otimes, R)$ is symmetric monoidal with structure maps:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
C \otimes C^\prime \arrow[r, "\Delta \otimes \Delta^\prime"] &
(C \otimes C) \otimes (C^\prime \otimes C^\prime) \arrow[r, "(23)"] &
(C \otimes C^\prime) \otimes (C \otimes C^\prime),
\end{tikzcd} \par
\begin{tikzcd}
C \otimes C^\prime \arrow[r, "\varepsilon \otimes \varepsilon^\prime"] &
R \otimes R \arrow[r, "\cong"] &
R.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

We will denote the category of monoids on a symmetric monoidal category $\C$ by $\Mon_{\C}$.\footnote{Monoids in $\Ch$ and $\coAlg$ are sometimes referred to as associative unital algebras and bialgebras respectively, but we avoid this terminology.}
