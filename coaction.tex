\section{Combinatorial $\M$-bialgebras}

Recall that a category is said to be \textit{small} if its objects and morphisms form sets. A category is said to be \textit{cocomplete} if any functor to it from a small category has a colimit.
If $\mathsf{A}$ is small and $\mathsf{C}$ cocomplete, then the (left) \textit{Kan extension of $g$ along $f$} exists for any pair of functors
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=normal, row sep=normal]
\mathsf{A} \arrow[d, "f"'] \arrow[r, "g"] & \mathsf{C} \\ 
\mathsf{B} \arrow[dashed, ur, bend right] & \quad .
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
Given categories $\mathsf{B}$ and $\C$, we denote the \textit{functor category} between them as $\Fun(\mathsf{B}, \C)$.
