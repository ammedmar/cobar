	We construct an explicit monoidal $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the cobar construction of chains on a reduced simplicial set and, more generally, on the chains of a monoidal cubical set. Furthermore, we prove that a classical map constructed by F. Adams comparing his cobar construction on the singular chains of a pointed space and the singular cubical chains on its based loop space is a quasi-isomorphism that preserves our structure. This work extends to its ultimate conclusion a theorem of H.J. Baues stating that Adams' map preserves a monoidal coalgebra structure.
