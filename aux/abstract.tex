	In the fifties, Adams introduced a comparison map from his cobar construction on the (simplicial) singular chains of a pointed space to the cubical singular chains on its based loop space.
	This comparison map is a quasi-isomorphism of algebras, which was shown by Baues to be one of bialgebras by considering Serre's cubical coproduct.
	In this work we generalize Baues result proving that Adams' comparison map is a quasi-isomorphism of $E_{\infty}$-bialgebras, i.e. of monoids in the category of $E_{\infty}$-coalgebras.
