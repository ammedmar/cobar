\section{The cobar construction}

Define the cobar construction of a connected dg coassociative coalgebra. 

Recall the construction of a coassociative associative bialgebra on the cobar construction of an $E_2$-coalgebra following Kadeishvhili/Matthias Franz. In fact, I think we can do this in the context of $U(M)$-coalgebras? Namely, if start with a $U(M)$-coalgebra then we may construct a coassociative coproduct on the cobar construction on the underlying $A_{\infty}$-coalgera by looking at its $E_2$ part.

Discuss the localized version of the cobar construction.
