\section{Introduction}

For any topological space $\fX$, its complex of simplicial or cubical singular chains $\Schains(\fX)$ -- regarded as a differential graded (dg) abelian group -- encodes the homology of $\fX$ in its quasi-isomorphism type.
More homotopical information can be stored in the quasi-isomorphism type of this chain complex if considered as a (dg) coassociative coalgebra, which we will denote $\SchainsA(\fX)$, where the coproduct comes from a canonical choice of chain approximation to the diagonal $\fX \to \fX \times \fX$, attributed respectively to Alexander--Whitney and Serre.
For example, the cohomology ring of $\fX$ is retained, but additional invariants like the action of the Steenrod algebra on its mod $p$ cohomology is not.
In Mandell's seminal work \cite{mandell2006homotopy_type} it is shown that, when $\fX$ is nilpotent and finite type, the entire homotopy type of $\fX$ can be encoded in the quasi-isomorphism type of this complex if considered as an $E_\infty$-coalgebra, a structure providing $\SchainsA(\fX)$ with coherent homotopies witnessing the derived cocommutativity of the coproduct coming from the strict symmetry of the diagonal map.

In this work we are interested in modeling algebraically the homotopy type of the based loop space $\loops_x \fX$ of a pointed space $(\fX, x)$.
Via concatenation of loops this space is a topological monoid, whose induced structure on the set of path-connected components is a group; the fundamental group of the underlying space.

The first contribution of this paper is to explicitly endow the cubical singular chains of $\loops_x \fX$ with the structure of a monoid in a category of $E_\infty$-coalgebras extending the Serre diagonal.
More specifically, we verify that the monoid structure induced by concatenation on $\cSchains(\loops_x \fX)$ is compatible with the $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on cubical singular chains introduced in \cite{medina2022cube_einfty}.

We will also concern ourselves with another algebraic approximation to the homotopy type of $\loops_x \fX$, which was introduced by Adams \cite{adams1956cobar}.
This model is obtained by applying Adams' celebrated \textit{cobar construction} functor $\cobar$ to a pointed version of the coalgebra of simplicial singular chains of $(\fX, x)$.
The cobar functor may be thought of as an algebraic counterpart to the based loop space.
Just like the based loop space functor is part of a duality between pointed topological spaces and group-like topological monoids, the cobar functor is part of an algebraic duality between a pointed version of dg coalgebras and monoids in chain complexes (i.e. dg algebras).

Adams' cobar construction provides a model for the quasi-isomorphism type of the monoid of chains on the based loop space.
In fact, Adams constructed a natural monoidal chain map $\theta$ from his model $\cobar \sSchainsA(\fX, x)$ to $\cSchains(\loops_x \fX)$ and proved it to be a quasi-isomorphism if $\fX$ is simply-connected, a statement that also holds true for path-connected spaces after \cite{rivera2018cubical}. The model $\cobar \sSchainsA(\fX, x)$ for the monoid of chains on the based loop space is smaller than $\cSchains(\loops_x \fX)$ and unlocks effective analysis of quantitative and qualitative properties of $\loops_x \fX$, see for instance \cite{chainalgebraloops} and \cite{adamscobarequivalence}.

The second main contribution of this paper is to make Adams model $\cobar \sSchainsA(\fX, x)$ into a monoid in $E_\infty$-coalgebras and to prove that
\[
\theta \colon \cobar \sSchainsA(\fX, x) \to \cSchains(\loops_x \fX)
\]
respects this higher structure.

Our starting point is groundbreaking work by H.~Baues, which imply statements similar to those in this work but in the category of coalgebras.
In \cite{baues1998hopf}, he reinterpreted Adams' algebraic construction at a deeper geometric level.
This allowed him to endow $\cobar \sSchainsA(\fX, x)$ with the structure of a monoid in coalgebras and to show that $\theta$ preserves this structure.
To prove the statements of this work we interpret Adams' constructions at an even deeper categorical level.
The simplicial singular complex $\sSing(\fX, x)$ is an example of an object in the category $\sSet^0$ of $0$-reduced simplicial sets.
We interpret Baues' geometric cobar construction, originally defined for $1$-reduced simplicial sets, as a functor
\begin{equation*}
	\ccobar \colon \sSet^0 \to \Mon_{\cSet},
\end{equation*}
where $\Mon_{\cSet}$ is the category of monoids in cubical sets.
The key difference with Baues' original work is the use of connections to obtain a natural construction before geometric realization.

Additionally, we need a suitable model of the $E_\infty$-operad, which we take to be the operad $\UM$ introduced in \cite{medina2020prop1}.
After proving that its coalgebras form a monoidal category, we show that the functor $\cchainsUM$ from cubical sets to $\UM$-coalgebras is monoidal, which implies that $\cchainsUM (\ccobar X)$ is a monoid in $\UM$-coalgebras for any 0-reduced simplicial set. More precisely, we prove the following.

\begin{theorem*}
	The functor $\cchainsUM$ is monoidal and its associated functor on monoids fits in the following diagram commuting up to natural isomorphisms:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd} [row sep=small]
		& \Mon_{\coAlg_\UM} \arrow[d] \\
		\Mon_{\cSet} \arrow[ru, "\cchainsUM", out=70, in=180, near start] \arrow[r, "\cchainsA"]
		& \Mon_{\coAlg} \arrow[d] \\
		\sSet^0 \arrow[r, "\cobar \schainsA"] \arrow[u, "\ccobar"]
		& \Mon_{\Ch},
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	where the unlabeled arrows are forgetful functors.
\end{theorem*}

In the above diagram, the arrow from $\sSet^0$ to $\Mon_{\Ch}$ is Adams' construction, the one from $\sSet^0$ to $\Mon_{\coAlg}$ is Baues' enhancement, and the one from $\sSet^0$ to $\Mon_{\coAlg_{\UM}}$ is our main contribution.

Additionally we have the following statement when the 0-reduced simplicial set comes from a pointed space.

\begin{theorem*}
	For any pointed space $(\fX, x)$, the map
	\[
	\theta \colon \cobar \sSchainsA(\fX, x) \to \cSchains(\loops_x \fX)
	\]
	is a quasi-isomorphism of monoids in $\UM$-coalgebras.
\end{theorem*}

As mentioned before, the fact that $\theta$ respects the monoid structure in $\Ch$ was proven by Adams, whereas the compatibility of the monoid structure with the Serre coalgebra structure was established by Baues.
Our contribution is the compatibility of the monoid structure with a full $E_\infty$-coalgebra extension of Serre's coalgebra.
