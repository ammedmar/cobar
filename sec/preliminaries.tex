\section{Conventions and preliminaries}\label{s:preliminaries}

\subsection{Presheaves and monoids}

Recall that a category is said to be \textit{small} if its objects and morphisms form sets.
We denote the category of small categories by $\Cat$.
Given categories $\sB$ and $\sC$ with $\sB$ small we denote their associated \textit{functor category} by $\Fun(\sB, \sC)$.
A category is said to be \textit{cocomplete} if any functor to it from a small category has a colimit.
If $\sA$ is small and $\sC$ cocomplete, then the (left) \textit{Kan extension} of $g$ along $f$ exists for any pair of functors $f$ and $g$ in the diagram below, and it is the initial object in $\Fun(\sB, \sC)$ making
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=normal, row sep=normal]
		\sA \arrow[d, "f"'] \arrow[r, "g"] & \sC \\
		\sB \arrow[dashed, ur, bend right] & \quad
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
commute.
A Kan extension along the \textit{Yoneda embedding}, i.e., the functor
\[
\yoneda \colon \sA \to \Fun(\sA^\op, \Set)
\]
induced by the assignment
\[
a \mapsto \big( a^\prime \mapsto \sA(a^\prime, a) \big),
\]
is referred to as a \textit{Yoneda extension}.
Objects in the image of the Yoneda embedding are said to be \textit{representable}.
Any presheaf $P$ is isomorphic to a colimit of representables presheaves $P \, \cong \colim_{\yoneda(a) \downarrow P} \yoneda(a)$.

A \textit{monoid} $(M, \mu, \eta)$ in a monoidal category $(\sC, \ot, \mathbb{1})$ is an object $M$ together with two morphisms $\mu \colon M \ot M \to M$ and $\eta \colon \mathbb{1} \to M$, called \textit{multiplication} and \textit{unit} respectively, satisfying the usual associativity and unital relations.
We denote the category of monoids in $\sC$ by $\Mon_{\sC}$ and remark that a monoidal functor $\sC \to \sC^\prime$ induces a functor between their categories of monoids $\Mon_\sC \to \Mon_{\sC^\prime}$.

\subsection{Coalgebras}\label{ss:coalgebras}

Throughout this article $\k$ denotes a commutative and unital ring and we work over its associated closed symmetric monoidal category of differential (homologically) graded $\k$-modules $(\Ch, \ot, \k)$.
We refer to the objects and morphisms of this category as \textit{chain complexes} and \textit{chain maps} respectively.
We denote by $\Hom(C, C^\prime)$ the chain complex of $\k$-linear maps between chain complexes $C$ and $C^\prime$, and refer to the functor $\Hom(-, \k)$ as \textit{linear duality}.
The $i^\th$ \textit{suspension} functor $s^i \colon \Ch \to \Ch$ is defined at the level of graded modules by $(s^{i}M)_n = M_{n-i}$.

A \textit{coalgebra} consists of a chain complex $C$ and chain maps $\Delta \colon C \to C \ot C$ and $\varepsilon \colon C \to \k$ satisfying the usual coassociativity and counitality relations.
This notion is equivalent to that of a comonoid in $\Ch$.
Denote by $\coAlg$ the category of coalgebras with morphisms being structure preserving chain maps.
The category $\coAlg$ is symmetric monoidal, with braiding induced from $\Ch$ and structure maps of a product $C \ot C^\prime$ given by
\begin{gather*}
	C \ot C^\prime \xra{\Delta \ot \Delta^\prime}
	(C \ot C) \ot (C^\prime \ot C^\prime) \xra{(23)}
	(C \ot C^\prime) \ot (C \ot C^\prime), \\
	C \ot C^\prime \xra{\varepsilon \ot \varepsilon^\prime}
	\k \ot \k \xra{\cong} \k.
\end{gather*}

A \textit{coaugmentation} on a coalgebra $C$ is a coalgebra map $\nu \colon \k \to C$.
A coalgebra is said to be \textit{coaugmented} if it is equipped with a coaugmentation.
We denote by $\coAlg^\ast$ the category of coaugmented coalgebras with morphisms being coaugmentation preserving coalgebra maps.
A coaugmented coalgebra is a \textit{connected coalgebra} if it is $0$ in negative degrees and the coaugmentation induces an isomorphism $\k \cong C_0$ of $\k$-modules.
We denote by $\coAlg^0$ the full subcategory of $\coAlg^\ast$ defined by these.

\subsection{Simplicial algebraic topology}\label{ss:simplicial}

The \textit{simplex category} is denoted by $\simplex$ and its objects by $[n]$.
%Its morphisms are generated by the usual \textit{coface} $\delta_i \colon [n-1] \to [n]$ and \textit{codegeneracy} $\sigma_i \colon [n+1] \to [n]$ maps.
The category of \textit{simplicial sets} $\Fun(\simplex^\op, \Set)$ is denoted by $\sSet$ and the \textit{standard $n$-simplex} $\yoneda [n] = \simplex(-, [n])$ by $\simplex^n$.
For any simplicial set $X$ we write, as usual, $X_n$ instead of $X [n]$, and identify the elements of $\simplex^n_m$ with increasing tuples $[v_0, \dots, v_m]$ where $v_i \in \{0, \dots, n\}$.

If $X$ is such that $X_0$ is a singleton set we say that $X$ is \textit{reduced}.
We denote the full subcategory of reduced simplicial sets by $\sSet^0$.

We denote the topological $n$-simplex by $\gsimplex^{n}$ and consider the usual adjunction pair defined by the \textit{geometric realization} and \textit{singular complex}
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	\bars{\ } \colon \sSet  \arrow[r, shift left=.5ex] &
	\Top :\! \sSing. \arrow[l, shift left=.5ex]
\end{tikzcd}
\]

The functor of (normalized) \textit{simplicial chains} $\schains \colon \sSet \to \Ch$ is obtained from the geometric realization and the functor of cellular chains.
When no confusion arises from doing so we write $\chains$ instead of $\schains$ and refer to it simply as the functor of \textit{chains}.
We will denote the functor of (simplicial) \textit{singular chains} $\schains \circ \sSing \colon \Top \to \Ch$ by $\sSchains$.

We modify this construction for a pointed topological space $(\fZ,z)$ by only considering maps $\gsimplex^n \to \fZ$ sending all vertices to $z$.
This produces a reduced simplicial set $\sSing(\fZ,z)$ whose chains we denote by $\sSchains(\fZ,z)$.

There is a classical lift of the functor of chains to coalgebras:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	& \coAlg \arrow[d] \\
	\sSet \arrow[r, "\schains"] \arrow[ur, "\schainsA", out=70, in=180] & \Ch
\end{tikzcd}
\]
defined, via a Yoneda extension, by the following structure on the chains of standard simplices.
For any $n \in \N$, define $\epsilon \colon \chains(\simplex^n) \to \k$ by
\[
\epsilon \big( [v_0, \dots, v_q] \big) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{ if } q = 0, \\ 0 & \text{ if } q>0, \end{cases}
\]
and $\Delta \colon \chains(\simplex^n) \to \chains(\simplex^n)^{\ot2}$ by
\[
\Delta \big( [v_0, \dots, v_q] \big) = \sum_{i=0}^q \ [v_0, \dots, v_i] \ot [v_i, \dots, v_q].
\]

If $X$ is a reduced simplicial set then $\schainsA(X)$ becomes a connected coalgebra with the coaugmentation $\nu \colon \k \to \schains(X)$ induced by sending $1$ to the basis element represented by the unique $0$-simplex of $X$.
Hence, the functor $\schainsA$ restricts to a functor
\[
\schainsA \colon \sSet^0 \to \coAlg^0.
\]

\subsection{Cubical algebraic topology}

The objects of the \textit{cube category} $\cube$ are the sets $2^n = \{0, 1\}^n$ with $2^0 = \{0\}$ for $n \in \N$, and its morphisms are generated by the \textit{coface, codegeneracy} and \textit{coconnection} maps defined by
\begin{align*}
	\delta_i^\varepsilon & =
	\mathrm{id}_{2^{i-1}} \times \delta^\varepsilon \times \mathrm{id}_{2^{n-1-i}} \colon 2^{n-1} \to 2^n, \\
	\sigma_i & =
	\mathrm{id}_{2^{i-1}} \times \, \sigma \times \mathrm{id}_{2^{n-i}} \quad \colon 2^{n} \to 2^{n-1}, \\
	\gamma_i & =
	\mathrm{id}_{2^{i-1}} \times \, \gamma \times \mathrm{id}_{2^{n-i}} \quad \colon 2^{n+1} \to 2^{n},
\end{align*}
where $\varepsilon \in \{0,1\}$ and
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	1 \arrow[r, out=45, in=135, "\delta^0"] \arrow[r, out=-45, in=-135, "\delta^1"'] & 2 \arrow[l, "\sigma"'] &[-10pt] \arrow[l, "\gamma"'] 2 \times 2
\end{tikzcd}
\]
are defined by
\begin{gather*}
	\delta^0(0) = 0, \qquad
	\delta^1(0) = 1, \qquad
	\sigma(0) = \sigma(1) = 0, \qquad \\
	\gamma^1(0,0) = 0, \qquad
	\gamma^1(0,1) = 1, \qquad
	\gamma^1(1,0) = 1, \qquad
	\gamma^1(1,1) = 1.
\end{gather*}
We remark that the cube category without connections will not be considered in this work.

The category of \textit{cubical sets} $\Fun(\cube^\op, \Set)$ is denoted by $\cSet$ and
the \textit{standard $n$-cube} $\yoneda 2^n = \cube(-, 2^n)$ by $\cube^n$.
For any cubical set $Y$ we write, as usual, $Y_n$ instead of $Y(2^n)$.

We denote the topological $n$-cube by $\gcube^{n}$ and consider the usual adjunction pair defined by the \textit{geometric realization} and \textit{singular complex}
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	\bars{\ } \colon \cSet  \arrow[r, shift left=.5ex] &
	\Top :\! \cSing. \arrow[l, shift left=.5ex]
\end{tikzcd}
\]

The functor of (normalized) \textit{cubical chains} $\cchains \colon \cSet \to \Ch$ is obtained from the geometric realization and the functor of cellular chains.
When no confusion arises from doing so we write $\chains$ instead of $\cchains$ and refer to it simply as the functor of \textit{chains}.
We remark that $\chains(\cube^n)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\chains(\cube^1)^{\ot n}$ and that $\chains(\cube^1)$ is canonically isomorphic to the cellular chains on the topological interval with its usual CW structure.
We use these isomorphisms to denote the elements of $\chains(\cube^n)$ as integral linear combinations monoids of the form $x_1 \ot\dotsb\ot x_n$ with $x_i \in \big\{[0], [0,1], [1] \big\}$.
We will denote the functor of (cubical) \textit{singular chains} $\cchains \circ \cSing \colon \Top \to \Ch$ by $\cSchains$.

There is a classical lift of the functor of cubical chains to the category of coalgebras
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	& \coAlg \arrow[d] \\
	\cSet \arrow[r, "\cchains"] \arrow[ur, "\cchainsA", out=70, in=180] & \Ch
\end{tikzcd}
\]
defined, using a Yoneda extension, by the tensor product structure (\cref{ss:coalgebras}) defined on $\chains(\cube^n) \cong \chains(\cube^1)^{\ot n}$ via the identification of $\chains(\cube^1)$ and $\chains(\simplex^1)$.

%\subsubsection{Cubical chains}
%
%For non-negative integers $m$ and $n$, let $\cube_{\deg}(2^m, 2^n)$ be the subset of \textit{degenerate morphisms} in $\cube(2^m, 2^n)$, i.e., those of the form $\sigma_i \circ \tau$ or $\gamma_i \circ \tau$ with $\tau$ any morphism in $\cube(2^m, 2^{n+1})$.
%The functor of (cubical) \textit{chains} $\cchains \colon \cSet \to \Ch$ is the Yoneda extension of the functor $\cube \to \Ch$ defined next.
%It assigns to an object $2^n$ the chain complex having in degree $m$ the module
%\[
%\frac{\k\{\cube(2^m, 2^n)\}}{\k\{\cube_{\deg}(2^m, 2^n)\}}
%\]
%and differential induced by
%\[
%\partial (\id_{2^n}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ (-1)^i \
%\big(\delta_i^1 - \delta_i^0 \big).
%\]
%To a morphism $\tau \colon 2^n \to 2^{n^\prime}$ it assigns the chain map
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=-3pt, column sep=normal,
%	/tikz/column 1/.append style={anchor=base east},
%	/tikz/column 2/.append style={anchor=base west}]
%	\cchains(\cube^n)_m \arrow[r] & \cchains(\cube^{n^\prime})_m \\
%	\big( 2^m \to 2^n \big) \arrow[r, mapsto] & \big( 2^m \to 2^n \stackrel{\tau}{\to} 2^{n^\prime} \big).
%\end{tikzcd}
%\]
%
%When no confusion arises we write $\chains$ instead of $\cchains$.


%\subsubsection{Cubical singular complex}
%
%Consider the topological $n$-cube
%\[
%\gcube^{n} = \{(x_1, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in [0,1]\}.
%\]
%The assignment $2^n \to \gcube^n$ defines a functor $\cube \to \Top$ whose Yoneda extension is known as \textit{geometric realization}.
%It has a right adjoint $\cSing \colon \Top \to \cSet$ given by
%\[
%Z \to \Big(2^n \mapsto \Top(\gcube^n, Z)\Big)
%\]
%and referred to as the \textit{cubical singular complex} of the topological space $Z$.
%We will refer to $\chains(\cSing Z)$ as the \textit{cubical singular chains} of $Z$ and for simplicity denote it by $\cSchains(Z)$.

%\subsubsection{Serre coalgebra}\label{ss:serre coalgebra}
%
%We review a classical lift of the functor of cubical chains to the category of coalgebras
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}
%	& \coAlg \arrow[d] \\
%	\cSet \arrow[r, "\cchains"] \arrow[ur, "\cchainsA", out=70, in=180] & \Ch.
%\end{tikzcd}
%\]
%Using a Yoneda extension, it suffices to equip the chains on standard cubes with a natural coalgebra structure.
%For any $n \in \N$, define $\epsilon \colon \chains(\cube^n) \to \k$ by
%\[
%\epsilon \left( x_1 \ot \dots \ot x_d \right) = \epsilon(x_1) \dotsm \epsilon(x_n),
%\]
%where
%\[
%\epsilon([0]) = \epsilon([1]) = 1, \qquad \epsilon([0, 1]) = 0,
%\]
%and $\Delta \colon \chains(\cube^n) \to \chains(\cube^n)^{\ot 2}$ by
%\[
%\Delta (x_1 \ot \dots \ot x_n) =
%\sum \pm \left( x_1^{(1)} \ot \dots \ot x_n^{(1)} \right) \ot
%\left( x_1^{(2)} \ot \dots \ot x_n^{(2)} \right),
%\]
%where the sign is determined using the Koszul convention, and we are using Sweedler's notation
%\[
%\Delta(x_i) = \sum x_i^{(1)} \ot x_i^{(2)}
%\]
%for the chain map $\Delta \colon \chains(\cube^1) \to \chains(\cube^1)^{\ot 2}$ defined by
%\[
%\Delta([0]) = [0] \ot [0], \quad \Delta([1]) = [1] \ot [1], \quad \Delta([0,1]) = [0] \ot [0,1] + [0,1] \ot [1].
%\]
%
%Using the canonical isomorphism $\chains(\cube^n) \cong \chains(\cube^1)^{\ot n}$, the coproduct $\Delta$ can be described as the composition
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}
%	\chains(\cube^1)^{\ot n} \arrow[r, "\Delta^{\ot n}"] & \left( \chains(\cube^1)^{\ot 2} \right)^{\ot n} \arrow[r, "sh"] & \left( \chains(\cube^1)^{\ot n} \right)^{\ot 2},
%\end{tikzcd}
%\]
%where $sh$ is the shuffle map that places tensor factors in odd position first.
