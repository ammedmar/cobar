	We prove that the classical map comparing Adams' cobar construction on the singular chains of a pointed space and the singular cubical chains on its based loop space is a quasi-isomorphism preserving explicitly defined monoidal $E_\infty$-coalgebra structures. This contribution extends to its ultimate conclusion a result of Baues, stating that Adams' map preserves monoidal coalgebra structures.
