\section{A necklical model for the based loop space}

We now describe a combinatorial model for the based loop space of a $0$-reduced simplicial set $X$. This particular model has the feature that after taking normalized chains we obtain a dg algebra which is naturally \textit{isomorphic} to the cobar construction on the connected dg coalgebra of simplicial normalized chains $\chains(X)$. We also describe a version of the model which is localized at the $1$-simplices of $X$ and recovers the extended cobar construction of Hess and Tonks. This localization step is required in the $0$-reduced case in order to obtain the correct homotopy type of the based loop space. 

The construction is best described using necklical sets, a notion closely related to both simplicial sets and cubical sets. This framework is present (in different forms) in the work of Baues, Dugger and Spivak, Rivera and Zeinalian, Rivera and Saneblidze, Galvez-Carrillo, Kaufmann, and Tonks, and others. Below we give a self contained exposition suitable for our purposes.
