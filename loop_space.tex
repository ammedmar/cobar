\section{A necklical model for the based loop space}

We now describe a cubical model for the based loop space of a reduced simplicial set $X \in \sSet^0$. This particular model has the feature that after taking cubical chains we obtain a dg algebra which is naturally \textit{isomorphic} to the cobar construction on the connected dg coalgebra of simplicial normalized chains $\schains(X)$. We also describe a version of the model which is localized at the $1$-simplices of $X$ and recovers the extended cobar construction defined in \cite{Hess-Tonks}. This localization step is required in order to obtain the correct homotopy type of the based loop space in the non-simply connected setting.

The construction of the combinatorial model for the based loop space is best described using necklical sets, a notion related to both simplicial sets and cubical sets with connections. Different approaches to this framework can be found in \cite{Baues}, \cite{Galvez-Kaufmann-Tonks}, \cite{Dugger-Spivak}, \cite{rivera-zeinalian-cubical}, \cite{Rivera-Saneblidze}, among other works. Below we give a self contained exposition suitable for our purposes.
