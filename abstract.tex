    In the fifties, Adams introduced a comparison map $\theta_Z \colon \cobar(S^\simplex(Z,z)) \to S^\cube(\loops_z Z)$ from his cobar construction on the (simplicial) singular chains of a pointed space $(Z, z)$ to the cubical singular chains on its based loops space $\loops_z Z$.
	This comparison map is a quasi-isomorphism of algebras, which was shown by Baues to be one of bialgebras by considering Serre's cubical coproduct.
	In this work we generalize Baues result by constructing an $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra structure on the cobar construction of the coalgebra of singular chains, and proving that Adams' comparison map is a quasi-isomorphism of $E_{\infty}$-bialgebras.
	We also show that, for a general reduced simplicial set $X$, Hess and Tonks' extended cobar construction on $\schains(X)$ is quasi-isomorphic to $\schains(\kan(X))$, the chains on the Kan loop group of $X$, as an $E_{\infty}$-coalgebra.
