\section{Introduction}
The philosophy is to construct an explicit $E_{\infty}$-bialgebra structure on the cobar model for the based loop space such that
\\
1) it is given by the action of a ``small" cofibrant model for the $E_{\infty}$-operad, recently introduced by A. Medina-Medina
\\
2) the topological applications include general spaces with arbitrary fundamental group and no finite type assumptions using the recent observations of M. Rivera and M. Zeinalian
